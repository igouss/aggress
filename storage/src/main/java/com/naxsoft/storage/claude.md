# Storage Abstraction Package

This package provides the core storage abstraction interfaces and base classes for data persistence operations across
different storage backends.

## Classes

### Persistent.java

**Purpose:** Core interface defining the contract for persistent data operations.  
**Architecture Role:** Storage abstraction layer providing unified API for different persistence backends.  
**Dependencies:** Common entity package  
**Used By:** Storage service implementations (Redis, Elasticsearch) and application services

### package-info.java

**Purpose:** Package-level documentation and annotations for the storage package.  
**Architecture Role:** Provides package metadata and storage architecture patterns.

## Architecture Integration

This package defines the **Storage Abstraction Layer**:

- **Backend Independence**: Abstracts storage operations from specific technologies
- **Consistent API**: Unified interface for CRUD operations across storage types
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows switching between storage implementations
- **Transaction Management**: Defines transaction boundaries for data operations

## Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic from business logic
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable storage backend implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: Focused interfaces for specific storage operations
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on storage abstractions

## Storage Implementations

- **Redis Storage**: Fast caching and temporary data (RedisDatabase)
- **Elasticsearch Storage**: Search indexing and querying (Elastic)
- **Future Backends**: Extensible for additional storage technologies

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep storage interfaces technology-agnostic
- Define clear transaction boundaries and error handling contracts
- Consider async/reactive patterns for high-performance operations
- Document data consistency guarantees for each storage type
